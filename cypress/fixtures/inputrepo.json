  "articleBody1": "Given all this, the way to work out how smart octopuses are is to look at what they can do. Octopuses have done fairly well on tests of their intelligence in the laboratory, without showing themselves to be Einsteins. They can learn to navigate simple mazes. ",
  "articleBody2": "They can use visual cues to discriminate between two familiar environments and then take the best route toward some reward. They can learn to unscrew jars to obtain the food inside—even from the inside out. But octopuses are slow learners in all these contexts. Against this background of mixed experimental results, however, there are countless anecdotes suggesting that a lot more is going on.",

First of all, these animals evolved large nervous systems, including large brains. Large in what sense? A common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) has about 500 million neurons in its body.

Human beings have many more—something nearing 100 billion—but the octopus is in the same range as various mammals, close to the range of dogs, and cephalopods have much larger nervous systems than all other invertebrates.As the cephalopod body evolved toward these modern forms—internalizing the shell or losing it altogether—another transformation occurred: some of the cephalopods became smart. “Smart” is a contentious term to use, so let's begin cautiously.
